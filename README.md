Size of individual records and Limitations of MongoDB server (MongoDB Atlas provides 500MB in free tier)
Can we cache records - (This can be done in memory or using Redis cache)
Can we add clustering to the app - (In NodeJS there is a feature to fork your app process to use all available cores by making copies of your application and running it on each core instead of running as a single process)
Adding Duplicacy Detection to check if the record being inserted is already in DB prior to inserting it
Always put-in validation checks and data limits for fields. (Ex - Not allowing caption text to be greater than 500 characters)
